 Working on a site for a restaurant where the owner needed a 'CMS' to edit the specials menu on a daily basis.  Rather than use a bloated CMS like wordpress/drupal/joomal etc, I thought it would be slick if they could just use a simple google sheet... This allows the site to remain flat from a static site generator and is SUPER easy to edit.  There are some usage restrictions from the Google Sheets API, but the cap is so high it will work just fine for a small project like a local restaurant.
